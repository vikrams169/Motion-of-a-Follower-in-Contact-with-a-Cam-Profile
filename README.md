# Motion-of-a-Follower-in-Contact-with-a-Cam-Profile
Different graphs, and their corresponding MATLAB codes, describing the displacement, velocity, acceleration, and jerk of a simple roller follower in contact with a cam profile rotating about its axis, plotted against the angle of revolution.
<br>
<br>
For this analysis, four different type of cam profiles have been analysed:
<br>1. An SHM Cam Profile
<br>2. A Cycloidal Cam Profile
<br>3. A Cam Profile giving a Constant Velocity
<br>4. A Cam Profile giving a Constant Acceleration
<br>
<br>
This analysis/plotting has been done as a part the course ME203 (Theory of Machines), at IIT Ropar.
